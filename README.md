# CKD
This data is taken from the UCI repository which contains the classification of chronic kidney disease.
Data from the source has some missing values.
Therefore, various methods such as regression analysis are used to overcome the missing values in the data.
In this data, we use the mean, median, and correlation between features to overcome missing values.
In addition, we also use the influence of the behavior of one feature on other features.
